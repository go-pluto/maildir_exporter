# maildir_exporter

Export Maildir file system metrics to Prometheus. This is primarily intended to make comparing file system state of two Maildirs more accessible. We make use of this possibility in our evaluation of [pluto](https://github.com/go-pluto/pluto) and [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org) on a cloud-native deployment.
